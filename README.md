In the far future, New Zealand and Australia find themselves at odds. 
A rogue nuclear warhead detonates in the auckland CBD. 
As a kiwi living in Auckland zoo, your life is changed forever when you bite into a green glowing huhu grub and your eyes begin to glow bright red. 
Lazers burst forth from your eyes as you become the first of the lazer kiwi's. 
You continue living your life, eating huhu grubs but are interrupted by the mechanical clanking of a robot kangaroo coming around an overturned car towards you.


You play as a lazer kiwi, fighting off robotic kangaroos, using the energy from radioative huhu grubs to power your weapons.
Huhu grubs give you points and lazer battery, defeating robot kangaroos give you points, the goal is to survive as long as possible against increasing waves of enemies as they start to overwhelm you.
